I would like to thank and express my sincere gratitude towards \textbf{Prof. Dr. Christof Fetzer} for giving me this opportunity to work on this super exciting and futuristic thesis at the Chair of Systems Engineering.

It was not an easy phase to work remotely on the thesis in the COVID-19 situation. However, my adviser \textbf{Dr.-Ing. Do Le Quoc} keeps me motivated to do things perfectly by providing constructive and honest feedback always. I want to thank him for putting such extra efforts for me.

I also want to thank my \textbf{parents}, \textbf{sister} and \textbf{friends} who always supported and gave me early feedback. A very special thanks to my friends who always supported me by staying around me and taking care of daily errands in the COVID-19 situation for me.
