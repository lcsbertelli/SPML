abstract = {Differential privacy describes a promise, made by a data curator to a data subject: you will not be affected, adversely or otherwise, by allowing your data to be used in any study, no matter what other studies, data sets, or information from other sources is available. At their best, differentially private database mechanisms can make confidential data widely available for accurate data analysis, without resorting to data clean rooms, institutional review boards, data usage agreements, restricted views, or data protection plans. To enjoy the fruits of the research described in this tutorial, the data analyst must accept that raw data can never be accessed directly and that eventually data utility is consumed: overly accurate answers to too many questions will destroy privacy. The goal of algorithmic research on differential privacy is to postpone this inevitability as long as possible.},

The current research studies mainly focus on privacy-preserving classification and regression. However, principal component analysis (PCA) is also an effective data analysis method which can be used to reduce the data dimensionality, commonly used in data processing, machine learning, and data mining. In order to implement approximate PCA while preserving data privacy, we apply the Laplace mechanism to propose two differential privacy principal component analysis algorithms: Laplace input perturbation (LIP) and Laplace output perturbation (LOP). We evaluate the performance of LIP and LOP in terms of noise magnitude and approximation error theoretically and experimentally. In addition, we explore the variation of performance of the two algorithms with different parameters such as number of samples, target dimension, and privacy parameter. Theoretical and experimental results show that algorithm LIP adds less noise and has lower approximation error than LOP. To verify the effectiveness of algorithm LIP, we compare our LIP with other algorithms. The experimental results show that algorithm LIP can provide strong privacy guarantee and good data utility.}, journal={Security and Communication Networks}, author={Xu, Yahong and Yang, Geng and Bai, Shuangjie}, year={2019} }

	Abstract = {A reasonable compromise of privacy and utility exists at an "appropriate" resolution of the data. We proposed novel mechanisms to achieve privacy preserving data publishing (PPDP) satisfying ε-differential privacy with improved utility through component analysis. The mechanisms studied in this article are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The differential PCA-based PPDP serves as a general-purpose data dissemination tool that guarantees better utility (i.e., smaller error) compared to Laplacian and Exponential mechanisms using the same "privacy budget". Our second mechanism, the differential LDA-based PPDP, favors data dissemination for classification purposes. Both mechanisms were compared with state-of-the-art methods to show performance differences.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes Lua, a language for extending applications. Lua combines procedural features with powerful data description facilities, by using a simple, yet powerful, mechanism of tables . This mechanism implements the concepts of records, arrays and recursive data types (pointers), and adds some object-oriented facilities, such as methods with dynamic dispatching. Lua presents a mechanism of fallbacks that allows programmers to extend the semantics of the language in some unconventional ways. As a noteworthy example, fallbacks allow the user to add different kinds of inheritance to the language. Currently, Lua is being extensively used in production for several tasks, including user configuration, general-purpose data-entry, description of user interfaces, storage of structured graphical metafiles, and generic attribute configuration for finite element meshes.},
